# 🧩 Inside Agents

> A small agent simulation project inspired by Pixar's *Inside Out*

## 🎬 Inspiration

This project was inspired by Pixar’s *Inside Out*.

In the movie, each of Riley’s emotions is personified as a tiny character sitting at a control panel in her mind, taking turns driving her thoughts and actions.

## 🧠 Project Structure

The project is built around a `BaseAgent` class that simulates the basic emotional state, sensitivity, and tool-using logic of each agent. Each subclass represents a different “personality tendency”:

- **`OptimistAgent`**: Positive, optimistic, and cheerful
- **`PessimistAgent`**: Negative and gloomy
- **`StrategistAgent`**: Rational, emotionally stable, and logical but slower to react
- **`SighAgent`**: The indifferent type — sighs, rolls eyes, and questions whether things are worth discussing (yes, I really added this!)
- **`NerveAgent`**: Highly influenced by others’ opinions, easily overwhelmed 😵

## 🚀 Future Plans

- [ ] Expand each agent’s behavior tree
- [ ] Build an interactive console to simulate multiple agents competing for “control”
- [ ] Experiment with a simple visualization tool
